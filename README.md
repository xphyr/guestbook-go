# Guestbook-go

## Intro

This is a fork of the [guestbook-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/guestbook-go) example app from the kubernetes project. I have updated the redis terminology to use primary secondary in all areas possible. The deployment objects have been changed from json files to yaml and consolidated to make deployment easier.

All the files are used as part of a blog post on using [Kata Containers in OpenShift](https://xphyr.net/post/kata_ocp/).
